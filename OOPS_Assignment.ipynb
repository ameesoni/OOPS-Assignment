        "\n",
        "Polymorphism in Python, particularly with inheritance, allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

In inheritance, polymorphism allows a subclass to provide its specific implementation of a method defined in a superclass.\n",

        "How It Works:\n",

        "Same Method Name: Different classes can define the same method, but each class provides its own behavior.\n",
